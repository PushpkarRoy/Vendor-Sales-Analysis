- Identify top-performing and underperforming vendors
- Optimize inventory turnover and procurement spending
- Uncover hidden profit opportunities in high-margin, low-sales products
- Enable data-driven decisions through interactive dashboards

## üêç Python Analysis

Used Python (Pandas) for:
- Data cleaning and joining multi-million row datasets
- Feature engineering (gross profit, margins, tax)
- Exporting a summarized vendor-product table for SQL & dashboarding

üìÑ Output file: `vendor_summary_table.csv`

## üßÆ SQL Analysis

PostgreSQL was used to:
- Calculate sales-to-purchase ratios and stock turnover
- Identify blocked capital in unsold inventory
- Rank vendors by efficiency, margin, and ROI
- Generate KPIs for dashboard integration

üìÅ File: `dB_Analysis_SQL.sql`

## üìä Power BI Dashboard

Interactive visual dashboard showing:
- Total purchase/sales value
- Gross profit vs excise tax
- Top vendors by profit and volume
- Low-sales, high-margin vendors
- Unit price comparison across brands

üìà KPI Cards, Pie Charts, Line + Bar Mix
