üîç Insights:

 ‚Ä¢ Vendor Concentration: The top 10 vendors account for 65.34% of the total purchase spending, 
 	showing that the majority of business is concentrated among a few key vendors.

‚Ä¢ Remaining Vendors: The other vendors (90% of the vendor pool) contribute only 34.66%, 
	indicating a long tail of smaller or less active vendors.

‚Ä¢ Supply Chain Implication: The company heavily depends on a limited number of vendors. 
	Any disruption with top vendors could significantly affect inventory and operations.

‚Ä¢ Opportunity: There is potential to diversify purchasing across more vendors or negotiate better deals with the top contributors.


‚úÖ Conclusion:
‚Ä¢   The organization‚Äôs purchasing is heavily skewed towards its top 10 vendors, 
	which together drive over 65% of the total procurement value. 
	Strategic efforts should focus on vendor risk management, price negotiations, and diversification.

üìä Analysis: Bulk Purchase Impact on Unit Price

 üîç Output Summary:
 
‚Ä¢ Large Orders ‚Üí ‚Çπ57.14 average unit cost

‚Ä¢ Medium Orders ‚Üí ‚Çπ10.82 average unit cost

‚Ä¢ Small Orders ‚Üí ‚Çπ5.50 average unit cost

‚úÖ Insights:
‚Ä¢ ‚ö° Vendors buying in bulk ("Large") pay the highest per-unit price.

‚Ä¢ This is counterintuitive, as bulk purchases usually reduce cost.

‚Ä¢ Indicates that higher volumes are being purchased for premium products, not low-cost items.

‚Ä¢ üí∞ Small and Medium order groups have much lower average prices.

‚Ä¢ Suggests they are buying cheaper items in smaller quantities.

‚Ä¢ üîÅ This analysis shows that bulk buying does not always equal cost savings if the product mix differs (e.g., premium vs. regular items).

üìå Business Outcome:

‚Ä¢ Bulk pricing benefits may be overshadowed by product type.

‚Ä¢ Companies need to differentiate whether bulk orders are driving down unit cost or simply reflect expensive product purchases.

‚Ä¢ Procurement teams should analyze volume vs. price on a product-level, not just vendor-level, for smarter purchasing decisions.

"""
‚úÖ Insights:
‚Ä¢ Stock Turnover < 1 implies these vendors are not selling inventory effectively.

‚Ä¢ High inventory value is sitting idle, increasing carrying costs and reducing cash flow efficiency.

‚Ä¢ Vendors like LAUREATE IMPORTS CO and AAPER ALCOHOL & CHEMICAL CO have zero inventory turnover, which could indicate:

	‚Ä¢ No sales activity, or

	‚Ä¢ Extremely slow-moving products.

‚Ä¢ Vendors such as TRUETT HURST and IRA GOLDMAN AND WILLIAMS, LLP also show very low product movement.

üìå Business Outcome & Recommendation:
‚Ä¢ üîç These vendors need a stock audit and detailed analysis of unsold inventory.

‚Ä¢ üß† Marketing and promotion strategies should be introduced to move the slow stock.

‚Ä¢ üö´ Consider reducing future orders or discontinuing low-turnover SKUs to prevent overstocking.

‚Ä¢ üìà Bundle offers, discounts, or alternative product placements may help improve turnover.

üí° Business Interpretation:

‚Ä¢ Combined, the top 3 vendors have over ‚Çπ50 lakh tied up in unsold stock.

‚Ä¢ This capital could be better utilized in faster-moving inventory or marketing.

‚úÖ Recommendation:

‚Ä¢ Review demand planning, and adjust future purchase quantities.

‚Ä¢ Implement tighter inventory control and vendor accountability measures.
